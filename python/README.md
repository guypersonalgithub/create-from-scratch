This repository uses Python 3.12.6 and Poetry 1.8.3.
You are required to have Python 3 installed and Poetry installed on a virtual environment.

- Configuration:

# Run poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true to create the virtual environment inside each workspace's folder, as otherwise the virtual environment would be created globally under the cache folder of Poetry, outside of the repository itself.

# Run poetry new <project> for a new workspace/package.

# Run poetry init for an existing workspace/package that you want to create a pyproject.toml file.

# Run poetry install for an existing workspace/package to install its associated packages.
